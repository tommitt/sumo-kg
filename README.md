## ðŸ¤” What is it?
Sumo KG is a LLM-based agent that automatically creates a knowledge graph out of the information provided in a conversational way.
Sumo can investigate the created knowledge graph and answer related questions.

## ðŸ”§ How does the agent work?
The agent autonomously decides whether to create a knowledge graph or answer related questions. In these endeavours it has the ability to call a tool for investigations. Otherwise, for non-related queries, the agent directly responds using a LLM.
